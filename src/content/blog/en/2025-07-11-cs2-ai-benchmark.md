Back in 2024, I wrote a blog post about Counter-Strike 2 matches inside a Major Championship context using OpenAI's GPT4 model.
In this post, I'm doing a benchmark of different LLM models for the same purpose.

Plus, add the map pool stats and did a tweak in the prompt to ask the LLM to try to predict the played maps.

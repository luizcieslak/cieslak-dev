I like LoFi music.

You probably have seen or listened to the classic "LoFi Girl" [radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk). It is still a hit, like if you open that link right now, probably there will be around 10K people listening to it. I also like the live chat that comes with it that foster interaction between the artists and the listeners.

For me, it started a music you would put to listen when studying, then working, then I began to notice I was listening to them in another ocasions as well. I started to add it in my personal playlist, then I noticed: well, I might have listened so much to it that I might have a good collection of my favourite ones and therefore I decided to share it in the wild.

To continue reading to this article, I invite you to turn it on below so we can hear the music together.

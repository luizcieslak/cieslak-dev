There is nothing under the sun when we say Safari is the new Internet Explorer. This comparison is made as Safari represents a [important share of the market size](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) while having a subpar experience compared to its competitors, similar to what happened with Internet Explorer in the 2010s.

While I don't think every browser should be a [fork of Chromium](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-edge-chromium-1ce9507c-f09d-4de6-a706-eb52f46be90c) and that WebKit engine contributes to a heterogenous ecosystem, I think the type of browser should be at least something the we must have [freedom to choose](https://www-theverge-com.translate.goog/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu)

Apple deliberately chose to push back PWA apps for quite some time now: https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/

It is important to recognize the work the partners at [Igalia](https://mariospr.org/2024/11/03/igalia-and-webkit-status-update-and-plans-2024/) do to improve the WebKit engine and I really hope this article gets outdated soon

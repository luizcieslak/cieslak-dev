Even though we filtered those, there is still articles that is mentioning the team in the list but some of them might be very unrelated. Take this example:

![HLTV Team page for Cloud9 with the "News" tab selected and the top article is the list has this title: "SAW DEAL LIQUID'S SEASON ANOTHER HEAVY BLOW WITH SHOWDOWN ELIMINATION".](/cs2/cs2-articles-unrelated.png)

The most recent article for Cloud9 Team have this title:

When we read it, we then can see Cloud9 is briefly mentioned in the last paragraph but it doesn't mention anything besides that at all

![Excerpt for the post mentioned earlier where it mentions Cloud9 in the following sentence: "SAW, on the other hand, have been growing in stature in recent times, establishing themselves on the border of the top 20 before qualifying for the PGL Major Copenhagen in impressive fashion. The Portuguese side will hope to add a Spring Final appearance to their resume, with Cloud9 the next opponent standing in their way".](/cs2/cs2-articles-unrelated2.png)

Compared to [this](https://www.hltv.org/news/38361/themongolz-crush-lynn-vision-to-qualify-for-pgl-major-copenhagen) other article that is very useful around how TheMongolZ team works and have won their regional qualify.

Getting only the articles that has the team name in the title is also not an option because there could be articles that mention a team player. For example, [this](https://www.hltv.org/news/38410/vini-we-made-the-right-call-picking-up-noway-and-decenty-they-are-incredible) is an interview with an Imperial team member.

![Excerpt for a HLTV post with title: "VINI: 'WE MADE THE RIGHT CALL PICKING UP NOWAY AND DECENTY, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE'" and subtitle "Imperial's captain was all smiles after his team went undefeated to make the Major.".](/cs2/cs2-articles-unrelated2.png)
